   * A node is critical if many high-traffic routes pass through it.

   * In transport terms:
   *   - Times Square will rank high because tons of taxi, subway, and bike
   *     trips connect through it.
   *   - A quiet residential zone in Staten Island will rank low.
   *
   * @param graph  The multi-modal transport graph
   * @param tol    Convergence tolerance — smaller = more precise but slower.
   *               0.001 is good for production, 0.01 for quick testing.
   * @param resetProb  Probability of random jump (damping = 1 - resetProb).
   *                   Standard value is 0.15.
